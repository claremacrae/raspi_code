## Clare Macrae's Raspberry Pi notes


A place to store my Raspberry Pi experiments and notes

This has evolved a way to share sets of links with friends who are interested in the Raspberry Pi.

The main areas are:

* [Getting Started](getting_started/)
* [Kids and Education](kids_and_education/)
* [Programming](programming/)
* [Reference](reference/)
* [Hardware](hardware/)
* [Fun](fun/)
* [Projects](projects/)
* [Seasons and Events](seasons_and_events/)

The files called `.md` are the ones of general interest.

## Clare Macrae's Raspberry Pi Scripts

*This section is probably only useful for me. It's a reminder of how to get these files onto a Raspberry Pi.*

* [Setup](setup/) 

To use this on a new NOOBS image:

Set up SSH key, as per [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).

Then:

    git clone git@github.com:claremacrae/raspi_code.git

Afterwards, remember to set git user info:

    git config --global user.name  ...
    git config --global user.email "..."

Old - pre-SSH - way of cloning:

    git clone https://github.com/claremacrae/raspi_code.git
