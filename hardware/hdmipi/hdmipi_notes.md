	* `[=]`Copy this to Dropbox
* `[=]` Set up the HDMIPi
	* Done 29/12/2014
	* It went fairly well
	* I got a little dust under the screen
	* The main problem was not tightening up the plastic nuts enough, so that the Pi and driver board are a little loose
	* But it is good enough!
	* The text size on it is tiny
	* [how do I change the text size on a Raspberry Pi?](http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/04/how-to-change-the-command-line-font-size/)
		* I've done this - I'm not sure how much difference it actually made, though!
