# Raspberry Pi Camera Module Notes

## Hardware

* Camera Module
    * [Camera articles on Raspberry Pi website](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/tag/camera-module)
    * [How to set up the camera hardware](http://www.raspberrypi.org/camera) - contains a useful list of example commands
    * [Rpi Camera Module](http://elinux.org/Rpi_Camera_Module) - excellent reference page at elinux.org
* Raspberry Pi Camera cases
    *  [RaspberryPi and camera cases round-up](http://www.recantha.co.uk/blog/?p=5351) - @recantha - 29 July 2013
* Infrared Camera

		* Missing instructions
			* Remember to ground yourself, before handling the camera module
			* Peel off the thin plastic sheeting before assembly
			* Do a test run of putting nuts on to screws - and try putting the nut all the way on and off - then pick the best four matches
		* this was *really* fiddly to attach the screws, especially whilst avoiding touching the camera electronics
		* there were 5 screws and 8 nuts - several combinations of which didn't fit together smoothly at all
		* And the supporting plate didn't fit comfortably into the side notches - and when I applied a tiny amount of pressure, one of the "legs" on the base plate snapped off 
			* It turned out that this was not helped by my not knowing to peel off the white plastic sheeting
		* The instructions say to use `-vf` to fix the orientation, but this produces a reflected image
		* The correct option is actually `-rot 180`

    * [BerryCam support](http://www.fotosyn.com/berrycam-support/)
        * But don't use `sudo` as it'll make root own all the photos - it works fine without sudo for me.
