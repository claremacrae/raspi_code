# Raspberry Pi Quick Setup

* **Later thought: if you download Raspbian instead of NOOBS, you can access key files on the PC, so long as you save with UNIX line endings**
* Install [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/)
* Change password
* Follow [My Raspberry Pi github repo](https://github.com/claremacrae/raspi_code/blob/master/README.md) - use this to quickly set up new Raspberry Pi NOOBS images
* Start a log file for the SD card image, and save it to Dropbox - `Computing/Raspberry Pi/raspi_card_logs`
